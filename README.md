# Cryptocurrencies
unsupervised machine learning using scikit-learn library, k-means, and PCA to discover patterns in bitcoin

## Crypto To the Moon
This analysis uses unsupervised machine learning to uncover what crytpocurrencies are traing on the market and how to group these, creating a classification system for a new investment arm for an advisory team.
Since there is no known output, unsupervised machine learning through clustering algorithms K-means and PCA is used supplemented by elbow curve, scatter and 3D plots to visualize the relationships.

## Process
1. Preprocess data to drop columns of no value, convert values, and assign variables to text
2. Reduce Data Dimension using Principal Component Analysis
3. Concatenate the new dataframes to create a new DF for visualizataions and create 3 distinct groups
4. Cluster Cryptocurrencies using K-means and create a 3D scatter plot
